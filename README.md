## About
<a name="about"></a>

The aim of this project is to create a simple FPS game, using no game engine. This allows for a low-level approach to game design, and therefore very thorough optimization.

In this case, I chose the C language along with only one very low-level library: SDL2 (in order to use OpenGL).
This means that rendering methods are close to nil, and that I had to start from scratch (although SDL and OpenGL can take some of the work out of the equation).

Although the context of the project resembles that of the 1990s, the game's content should resemble a modern FPS. The game should therefore include familiar mechanics (this won't be 1993's Doom).

### About SDL2
<a name="about-sdl2"></a>

#### Context
The first question to ask is: how do you display elements on screen? As the display is connected directly to the GPU, you need to ask the graphics drivers politely.
This is usually done via standardized languages called specifications. Their implementation is the responsibility of the card manufacturer.

The best-known are DirectX, Vulkan and OpenGL. Although Vulkan is the most recent and was specifically designed for optimization, taking into account recent technological advances, OpenGL remains the most widely used, open-source and, above all, the easiest to learn.

> OpenGLÂ® is the most widely adopted 2D and 3D graphics API in the industry, bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. It is window-system and operating-system independent as well as network-transparent. OpenGL enables developers of software for PC, workstation, and supercomputing hardware to create high-performance, visually compelling graphics software application

#### SDL

> Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

on *libsdl.org*

As OpenGL is a set of specifications and not a library, I had to choose a library that would allow me to create a context around it, like opening a window.
Among the many choices available (GLFW, GLUT, SFML, ...), one stood out for its characteristics:

- SDL2 is renowned for its lightweight design, which ensures efficient resource utilization without compromising performance.

- One of the key advantages of SDL2 is its provision of low-level access to graphics, but also audio drivers, and input devices.

- SDL2's cross-platform compatibility makes it easy to seamlessly operate on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Overall, I think SDL2 is best suited to video game design.

### Built with
<a name="built-with"></a>

* [C][c-url]
* [Assimp][assimp-url] (5.3.1)
* [cglm][cglm-url] (0.9.2)
* [GLEW][glew-url] (2.1.0)
* [SDL2][sdl-url] (2.28.5)
* [SDL_mixer][sdl_mixer-url] (2.6.3)

#### Quick note

Assimp stands for Asset Importer Library. It's a library that makes it extremely easy to import 3D files, such as models or animations. I chose to use it because it allows you to import a wide variety of formats, but ESPECIALLY because the output format is standardized, and import is fast and optimized.

cglm stands for OpenGL Mathematics (glm) for C. It is a highly optimized 2D/3D math library. cglm provides lot of utils to help math operations to be fast and quick to write. The functions implemented take advantage of SSE2 and vectorization.

SDL_mixer is not part of the default SDL library. However, it is an official SDL extension promoted on the SDL website.
It is also practically indispensable when developing a game, as it allows several sounds to be played at the same time, which is impossible with SDL alone.

GLEW stands for OpenGL Extension Wrangler. It is an extension that loads OpenGL function headers :
as stated before, OpenGL's implementation is the responsibility of the card manufacturer. GLEW takes care of retrieving and normalizing function names.

> GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL core and extension functionality is exposed in a single header file.

## Getting started
<a name="getting-started"></a>

#### Try the game
If you just want to try out the game, simply download the `release.zip` file.

Please note that the game files given in this zip file are only compatible with 64-bit Windows systems. Pre-compiled versions of the game may be available in the future for Linux, macOS and Windows 32-bit, but nothing is guaranteed.

For the moment, no interface or menu has been implemented, so that there's no way to change  key bindings from within the game.

Current bindings are detailed in <a href="#usage">Usage</a>.

#### Edit code

Otherwise, follow these steps:

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">Up</a>)</p>

### Prerequisites
<a name="prerequisites"></a>

* C : Any compiler will do. I personally used GCC 13.2.0 through [WinLibs][winlibs-url].
* Assimp : Assimp doesn't provide binaries, this means you need to download their source code and build them yourself. See their [website](https://assimp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/quickstart.html#building-the-library-from-scratch) for more information.
* cglm : Download latest release on GitHub. cglm doesn't provide binaries either, but I'm only using the header files, which contain the `inline` functions
* GLEW : Download GLEW binaries on their website.
* SDL2 : Download the development (`devel`) version of SDL2. I chose the `mingw` one.
Inside the zip file are the 32- and 64-bit SDL library files. Choose the one that suits your system.
* SDL_mixer : As with SDL, download the development (`devel`) version of SDL_mixer. I chose the `mingw` one.
Inside the zip file are the 32- and 64-bit SDL library files. Choose the one that suits your system.

### Installation
<a name="installation"></a>

1. Clone the repository
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Dozer35/retro-fps.git
  ```

  or download code as Zip.

2. Add the `include` and `lib` directories of the SDL library files you downloaded earlier to `src`. Also put the content of the `bin` folder (`bin/SDL2.dll` for Windows) inside of `bin`
  The project tree should then contain :
  - `src/include/SDL2/*.h`
  - `src/lib/*.a`
  - `bin/SDL2.dll`

    Follow the same procedure for SDL_mixer, GLEW and Assimp.

    As for cglm, all you have to do is add `cglm/*.h` to `include/cglm` and just include the header `<cglm/cglm.h>` (and nothing else !).
3. WINDOWS - Compile the project with :
  ```sh
    gcc -Wall -I src/include -L src/lib -o build/retro_fps src/main.c $(Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path src/include -Filter \"*.c\").FullName -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer -lopengl32 -lglew32 -lassimp
  ```
  If you don't want the program to open the terminal, add `-mwindows`.


  UNIX - A Makefile is available. Alternatively, compile the project with :

  ```
    gcc -Wall -I src/include -L src/lib -o build/retro_fps src/main.c $(find src/include -name "*.c") -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer -lopengl32 -lglew32 -lassimp
  ```
  A compiled file will then be generated as `build/retro_fps` or `build/retro_fps.exe`, depending on your OS.

## Usage
<a name="usage"></a>

### Gameplay
<a name="gameplay"></a>

In its current state, the game only allows you to move freely in a black space. The player can run and look around.
The stage also contains brick cubes and a movable light source.

This is a placeholder for the level.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">Up</a>)</p>

### Bindings
<a name="bindings"></a>

It is currently not possible to change default bindings without modifying `src/main.c` and recompiling the whole code.
In the future, the player should be able to modify its bindings in-game.

By default, the bindings are :
- H - Forward
- B - Reverse
- V - Left
- N - Right
- Space - Jump
- Left click - Shoot (Not fully implemented)

- Esc - Pause the game
- F1 - Close the game

Other bindings are set in the game files, but they are not used yet.

## Product
<a name="product"></a>

This section organizes the development process, defining a minimal viable product and a roadmap for development.

### MVP
<a name="mvp"></a>

Achieving the Minimum Viable Product would already be a success. Further development is not guaranteed and may depend on factors such as development time, will or other external factors (free time, ...).

MVP should be a classic, straightforward FPS in the spirit of Doom :
- First-person camera
- Guns
- Enemies
- Sound effects

Overall, the game MUST be playable and enjoyable.

### Known Issues
<a name="known-issues"></a>

Various bugs and issues may appear during development, but no direct solution is found. Here is a list of known issues for which no solution has yet been found. By the way, if you manage to find a bug during a game, don't hesitate to share it in Issues.
- The game may take a few seconds to launch, due to a line in the code which is still being used as a test. Everything will be optimized very soon, and the slowdown will no longer be noticeable.
